# Real-time-Vehicle-number-plate-identification-

An automatic system based on "Digital Image Processing" technology is developed using Opencv
tool to recognize the vehicle by identifying the license plate. A database is linked to the MATLAB processor, which takes input as the detected number plate. Information about the owner is extracted and electronic format of the challan is generated if the number plate is in wrong format. Also in case of theft or crime, the required number plate is fed to the database system and if it is matched with the detected number plate, an alert is generated.
